NCAA Basketball (men's and women's!) game information intended for use as a second screen while watching a game

This web app shows some information that may not be visible on a game broadcast, such as the stats of the starters or players on the floor, players in foul trouble, scoring/rebounding/assist leaders for each team, and win probability for each team. Early in development, more features to come soon!
